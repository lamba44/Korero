**Project Name:** Korero

**Description:**
Korero is an advanced AI-driven software solution designed to translate sign language into text in real-time. Powered by Keras models, it seamlessly processes live video feeds, employing OpenCV and CVZone for precise hand tracking. Our meticulously curated dataset, comprising 7200 images (300 per alphabet), ensures accuracy. Leveraging Google's Teachable platform, we've developed a robust model using TensorFlow in Python.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time sign language translation to text
- Seamless integration of Keras models
- Precise hand tracking with OpenCV and CVZone
- Extensive dataset for comprehensive training (7200 images, 300 for each alphabet)
- Model development through Google's Teachable platform
